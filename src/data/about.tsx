        Our student visits are thoughtfully organised with schools and colleges worldwide. Every group is accompanied by professional staff and experienced educators, ensuring a safe and supportive experience in the UK.<br /><br />
        The programme is lively and immersive. Mornings are filled with trips to Britain’s most inspiring cultural and educational destinations from the historic halls of Oxford University to the Houses of Parliament and beyond.

        As a host, you’ll welcome two or more students into your home, offering them breakfast and dinner in a family setting, and preparing a packed lunch for their adventures. With students out exploring most of the day, you’ll have time for your own activities.<br /><br />
        Hosts receive a payment for each student, but the real benefit is cultural exchange. Welcoming young people from different backgrounds is a chance to share new languages, traditions, and perspectives.

        Hosting allows students to experience authentic British life and your household gains something special in return. If you have children of similar age, these connections often turn into lasting friendships and memories.
